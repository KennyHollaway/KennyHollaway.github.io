   Hey my name is Kenny, I am 24, married with two wonderful children. I have been working since I was 14 doing different jobs, mainly production related, all throughout school. Had plans to go straight into tech school when I graduated due to the passion I have to know how things work and coding is everything when you need something to work. But life had other plans for me, having my daughter at 18 put all my dreams and plans on hold. 
		 I worked any job that would come my way to provide for my family, so we can have a comfortable life and not have to worry about being without. Then as soon as we knew it a year ago we were blessed with the opportunity to adopt my nephew when he was three months old. Which again put everything else on the back burner.
	  	But, now my family and I are ready for the next step in are lifes, where I go after my dream of study tech and code to better us in the future. So to answer the question of why I decided to be a software engineer is a two part answer, one being a dream I put off six years ago and second to better my family's future.
